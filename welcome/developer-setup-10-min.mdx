This is the fastest path to start building for MARS.

## Goal

Get an editor connected to your robot over SSH in about 10 minutes.

## Steps

1. Install a VSCode-based editor (VSCode, Cursor, or Windsurf).
2. Add the Remote SSH extension.
3. Get your robot IP from the app (**Configuration -> WiFi**).
4. Connect with `ssh jetson1@<robot-ip>`.
5. Open your workspace on the robot (for example `~/innate-os`).
