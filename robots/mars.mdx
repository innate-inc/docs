MARS is a compact mobile manipulator with onboard AI compute, designed as a complete platform for building and sharing real-world robot applications.

## Hardware at a glance

### Sensors

MARS features a comprehensive sensor suite with three primary sensors:

#### Forward-Facing RGBD Camera

* High-quality depth perception with 6.0 cm stereo baseline
* 150° diagonal field of view
* Effective depth range: 40 cm to 6 m
* Depth accuracy: &lt;2% error up to 3.5 m, &lt;4% to 6.5 m, &lt;6% to 9 m

#### Gripper-Mounted RGB Camera

* 160° diagonal field of view
* 2MP resolution (1920x1080)
* 30 FPS at full resolution
* Ideal for close-range manipulation tasks and visual servoing

#### 2D LiDAR

* 360° scanning coverage
* Range: 0.15 m to 6 m
* Angular resolution: &lt;=1°
* Distance resolution: &lt;0.5 mm
* Scan rate: 10 Hz
* Primary sensor for SLAM and navigation

This sensor configuration enables robust perception, precise manipulation, and reliable navigation.

#### Custom sensors

MARS provides two powered USB 3.0 ports for additional sensors/peripherals:

* 2x USB 3.0 ports
* Power output: 1.2 A per port
* Data transfer rate: up to 5 Gbps
* Hot-swappable
* Full compatibility with USB 2.0 devices

### Arm

#### Specifications

* Reach: 40 cm
* Repeatability: 2 mm
* Payload: 250 g at maximum extension

#### Actuators

| Qty | Actuator | Model | Link |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | Dynamixel XL430 (Robotis) | `XL430-W250-T` | [Product Page](https://www.robotis.us/dynamixel-xl430-w250-t/) |
| 1 | Dynamixel XC430 (Robotis) | `XC430-T240BB-T` | [Product Page](https://www.robotis.us/dynamixel-xc430-t240bb-t/) |
| 4 | Dynamixel XL330 (Robotis) | `XL330-M288` | [Product Page](https://www.robotis.us/dynamixel-xl330-m288-t/) |

These actuators were chosen for robustness and repeatability. The arm can reliably perform tasks such as chess manipulation (see [Examples](/welcome/mars-example-use-cases)).

### Onboard Computer

MARS ships with a [Jetson Orin Nano Super 8GB Development Kit](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-orin/nano-super-developer-kit/).

Specs:

* **AI Performance:** Up to 67 TOPS (sparse INT8)
* **GPU:** NVIDIA Ampere architecture with 1024 CUDA cores and 32 Tensor cores
* **CPU:** 6-core ARM Cortex-A78AE v8 (64-bit)
* **Memory:** 8 GB LPDDR5
* **Storage:** 1 TB SSD (integrated by Innate) + 32 GB microSD (for OS)
* **Developer Kit Includes:** Jetson Orin Nano Super module and reference carrier board

Innate also exposes two additional USB ports for user extensions after core system wiring.

## Platform details

MARS is delivered assembled and calibrated so you can start quickly, while still being open and mod-friendly for deeper customization.
