MARS is a compact mobile manipulator with onboard AI compute, designed as a complete platform for building and sharing real-world robot applications.

## Hardware at a glance

### Sensors

MARS combines complementary perception sources: a forward-facing RGBD camera for scene depth, a gripper-mounted RGB camera for close manipulation, and a 2D LiDAR for localization.

#### Camera matrix

| Spec | Forward-Facing RGBD Camera | Gripper-Mounted RGB Camera |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Camera type | Stereo RGBD | RGB |
| Diagonal field of view | 150° | 160° |
| Effective range | 40 cm to 6 m | Close-range manipulation |
| Depth support | Yes | No |
| Depth accuracy | &lt;2% up to 3.5 m, &lt;4% to 6.5 m, &lt;6% to 9 m | N/A |
| Resolution | N/A | 2MP (1920x1080) |
| Frame rate | N/A | 30 FPS |
| Primary role | Navigation and scene perception | Visual servoing and grasp alignment |

#### 2D LiDAR

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Coverage | 360° |
| Range | 0.15 m to 6 m |
| Angular resolution | &lt;=1° |
| Distance resolution | &lt;0.5 mm |
| Scan rate | 10 Hz |
| Primary use | SLAM and navigation |

#### Custom sensors

MARS provides two powered USB 3.0 ports for additional sensors/peripherals.

| Port property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| USB ports | 2x USB 3.0 |
| Power output | 1.2 A per port |
| Data rate | Up to 5 Gbps |
| Hot swap | Supported |
| Backward compatibility | USB 2.0 devices supported |

### Arm

#### Specifications

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Reach | 40 cm |
| Repeatability | 2 mm |
| Payload | 250 g at maximum extension |

#### Actuators

| Qty | Actuator | Model | Link |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | Dynamixel XL430 (Robotis) | `XL430-W250-T` | [Product Page](https://www.robotis.us/dynamixel-xl430-w250-t/) |
| 1 | Dynamixel XC430 (Robotis) | `XC430-T240BB-T` | [Product Page](https://www.robotis.us/dynamixel-xc430-t240bb-t/) |
| 4 | Dynamixel XL330 (Robotis) | `XL330-M288` | [Product Page](https://www.robotis.us/dynamixel-xl330-m288-t/) |

These actuators were chosen for robustness and repeatability. The arm can reliably perform tasks such as chess manipulation (see [Examples](/get-started/mars-example-use-cases)).

### Onboard Computer

MARS ships with a [Jetson Orin Nano Super 8GB Development Kit](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-orin/nano-super-developer-kit/).

| Component | Specification |
| --- | --- |
| AI performance | Up to 67 TOPS (sparse INT8) |
| GPU | NVIDIA Ampere architecture with 1024 CUDA cores and 32 Tensor cores |
| CPU | 6-core ARM Cortex-A78AE v8 (64-bit) |
| Memory | 8 GB LPDDR5 |
| Storage | 1 TB SSD (integrated by Innate) + 32 GB microSD (for OS) |
| Dev kit base | Jetson Orin Nano Super module and reference carrier board |

Innate also exposes two additional USB ports for user extensions after core system wiring.

## Platform details

MARS is delivered assembled and calibrated so you can start quickly, while still being open and mod-friendly for deeper customization.
