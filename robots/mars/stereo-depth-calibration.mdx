title: "Stereo Depth Calibration"
---

MARS now has stereo depth vision for navigation and obstacle avoidance. Since cameras can vary slightly from unit to unit, each robot must be calibrated.

Run this calibration:

* After your first setup.

* After major OS updates that include depth changes.

* Any time depth readings look wrong or unstable.

***

## 1) Prepare the calibration board

Download and print the official board:

* [Download calibration board (PDF)](https://github.com/innate-inc/web-docs/blob/main/.gitbook/assets/mars-calibration-board.pdf)

<Frame caption="Print this board at 100% scale.">

</Frame>

Important setup notes:

* Print at **100% scale** (no "fit to page" scaling).

* Cut a letter-sized piece of cardboard.

* Stick the printed board flat on the cardboard.

* Do not cover any checker squares or markers.

* The outside edges do not need to be perfect; the board being flat is what matters.

## 2) Start calibration from the app

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Innate Controller App">
    Make sure your phone is connected to the same robot session.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Configuration -> Depth and tap Start calibration">
    Use the **Configuration** tab, open **Depth**, then start calibration.
    <div className="calibration-app-screens">

      </Frame>
    </div>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Place the board when MARS raises its hand">
    Place the board in front of the hand with the calibration pattern facing the robot's head, then hold it steady until MARS grabs it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 3) Let calibration finish

* Keep clear while MARS runs the calibration sequence.

* Wait for the app to report completion.

* If calibration fails, repeat the process with better board flatness and stability.

After completion, run **Configuration -> Depth -> Check depth** to validate readings before normal navigation.
