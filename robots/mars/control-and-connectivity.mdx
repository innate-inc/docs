## Control via App and Leader Arm

MARS (and all Innate robots) are controllable via the Innate app:

Every MARS robot comes with a leader arm attachable to your phone:

</Frame>

The app automatically recognizes your arm. Press the red **Arm** button to control MARS with the leader arm. For best results, stand behind the robot while teleoperating.

**iOS users:** The leader arm connects via USB-C and is not compatible with iOS devices. Reach out on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/KtkyT97kc7) for access to a free Android phone for leader arm teleoperation.

### Mapping your space

Before autonomous navigation, map your environment with these guidelines:

* Keep the arm in a safe resting position
* Keep the camera unobstructed
* Drive slowly and steadily
* Cover each room, corners, and doorways

For examples, see [MARS Quick Start](/welcome/mars-quick-start).

## Connecting to a Robot (Wi-Fi + BLE)

The app connects to your robot via Wi-Fi. It can also work through your phone hotspot.

### First-time connection flow

This is the same onboarding flow covered in [Quick Start](/welcome/mars-quick-start).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Bluetooth pairing">
    The app uses BLE to discover the robot and initialize network setup.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wi-Fi configuration">
    Select the Wi-Fi network the robot should join. If the robot is not yet
    connected to any Wi-Fi, use screen 2 to pick a network and enter its
    password.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect over Wi-Fi">
    Once your phone and robot are on the same network, the app connects over Wi-Fi.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The robot publishes a `.local` hostname (for example `mars-robot.local`) so you can still connect if IP changes.

  </Card>
  <Card title="2. Join Network">
    <img src="/images/main/robots/innate-controller-app/connect-step-2.png" alt="Wi-Fi selection step" />
    If the robot is not connected yet, choose a Wi-Fi network here and set the password.
  </Card>

    <img src="/images/main/robots/innate-controller-app/connect-step-3.png" alt="Change Robot Wi-Fi step" />
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Once connected, you can view the current robot IP in **Configuration** -> **WiFi**.

## Connecting via SSH

Default credentials:

* **Username:** `jetson1`
* **Password:** `goodbot`

### Via Wi-Fi

If your robot is on the same network as your computer:

```bash
ssh jetson1@<robot-name>.local
```

Hostname conversion rules:

* Uppercase letters become lowercase
* Spaces/special characters become `-`
* Duplicate hyphens are collapsed
* Leading/trailing hyphens are removed

Examples:

| Robot name | Hostname | SSH command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `My Robot` | `my-robot.local` | `ssh jetson1@my-robot.local` |
| `MARS_01` | `mars-01.local` | `ssh jetson1@mars-01.local` |
| `Test Bot` | `test-bot.local` | `ssh jetson1@test-bot.local` |

If unnamed, default hostname is:

```bash
ssh jetson1@mars.local
```

### Via Ethernet (preferred wired method)

Connect Ethernet between computer and robot, then SSH:

```bash
ssh jetson1@192.168.50.2
```

Set your computer Ethernet interface to static IPv4:

* IP: `192.168.50.1`
* Netmask: `255.255.255.0`
* Gateway: empty
* DNS: empty

### Via USB-C (last resort)

USB-C is not recommended and should only be used when Wi-Fi and Ethernet are unavailable.

```bash
ssh jetson1@192.168.55.1
```
