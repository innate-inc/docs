title: "Extending MARS"
---

MARS was designed for hardware extensibility through several features:

* Most GPIO pins are available on the onboard computer.

* Two USB-A extension ports are available at the top of the robot.

* The hardware is [open-sourced](https://innate.bot/tbd) in order to be easier to modify, in particular the end-effector.

We describe below how we recommend to extend MARS on the hardware side.

## Changing the end-effector

The end effector by default is a gripper (opposable thumbs).

By nature of robot learning, if you change the end effector to any other shape, you will have to recollect your data for your manipulation models, but nothing else in the operating system needs to change if you still use the last actuator.

Examples of two different types of end effectors we used without changing the code:

## Adding sensors and effectors on the USB and GPIOs

Users can integrate additional sensors on the available ports. For any added device, make sure it is mounted and installed properly on the robot. You can then feed data into the BASIC OS by creating a `Sensor` object in the SDK (TBD).

Some sensors we have already tried and work plug-and-play on MARS:

* TONOR directional microphone ([$29 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSCT63BL?ref=fed_asin_title)) - MARS already has a built-in microphone. This optional add-on improves directional pickup. Plug it in and use `TONORMicrophoneInput` (TBD).

* Blackiot [Polverine Air Quality Sensor](https://blackiot.swiss/polverine).

#### Example: Adding a directional microphone (optional)

MARS can already listen with its built-in microphone. If you want more directional pickup, plug in a directional microphone and follow the [Example: Microphone](/software/inputs/example-microphone) guide.
