Core autonomous behavior on MARS is split across navigation and manipulation.

## Navigation

MARS supports multiple navigation modes through the Innate Controller App.

### Map-Free mode (default)

Map-free mode uses the local costmap from onboard sensors and does not require a pre-built map. It is best for:

* Fast deployment in new environments
* Dynamic spaces
* Simple point-to-point tasks
* Outdoor scenarios

### Mapping mode

To build a map:

1. Open the Innate Controller App.
2. Go to **Configuration** -> **Mapping**.
3. Select **Create New Map**.
4. Drive MARS through the full environment.
5. Save the map.

During mapping:

* Keep the arm in a safe resting position
* Drive slowly for cleaner map quality
* Cover corners and doorways

### Navigation with maps

After saving a map, MARS can navigate autonomously to selected goals.

### Go-To mode

1. Open the map view in the app.
2. Enable **Go-To Mode**.
3. Tap and drag to define position and orientation.
4. MARS plans and executes the trajectory.

You can stop at any time with the app **Stop** button.

### Stability improvements

* Dynamic footprint adapts to arm position
* Reduced zigzag behavior for smoother paths
* Better goal tolerance at arrival

### For developers

Navigation mode is published on `/nav/current_mode` with values:

* `mapfree`
* `mapping`
* `navigation`

See [ROS2 Reference](/software/advanced/ros2-reference) for interface details.

## Manipulation

Detailed manipulation docs are still being expanded.

For current workflows and demos, see [MARS Quick Start](/welcome/mars-quick-start).
