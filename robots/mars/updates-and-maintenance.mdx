Keep your robot stable and current with software updates, safe charging, and core configuration checks.

## Updating MARS

Use `innate-update` on the robot to fetch and apply MARS OS updates.

Updating will:

* Fetch the latest compatible Innate OS version
* Apply code and configuration changes
* Restart robot software services

If update notes include stereo-depth changes, run [Calibration](/robots/mars/calibration) before normal navigation.

### Prerequisites

* You can access the robot over SSH
* `innate-update` is available on the robot
* The robot has internet access

### Basic workflow

```bash
innate-update status
innate-update check
innate-update apply
```

Use `status` to verify current version, `check` to view available updates, and `apply` to install.

During `apply`, services may restart and the robot can be temporarily unresponsive.

If update commands fail, retry once and capture:

* The command you ran
* Full terminal error output

## Charging the Battery

Charging has a dedicated page with full safety instructions and a step-by-step procedure.

## Changing the Voice

MARS uses [Cartesia](https://cartesia.ai/) for text-to-speech.

### Method 1: `.env` (recommended)

1. SSH into the robot.
2. Edit `.env`:

```bash
nano ~/innate-os/.env
```

3. Add or update:

```bash
CARTESIA_VOICE_ID=your-voice-id-here
```

4. Restart robot services.

### Method 2: launch file (advanced)

1. Edit launch file:

```bash
~/innate-os/ros2_ws/src/brain/brain_client/launch/brain_client.launch.py
```

2. Update `cartesia_voice_id` default value.
3. Rebuild:

```bash
cd ~/innate-os/ros2_ws && colcon build
```

4. Restart MARS.

You can use existing Cartesia voices or create a custom voice:
