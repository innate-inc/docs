Use this page when MARS behavior is unexpected or you need common operational answers.

## Troubleshooting

### Connect via SSH

First, [connect over SSH](/robots/mars/connecting-via-ssh).

### Inspect processes in tmux

MARS runs its software stack inside a `tmux` session:

```bash
tmux attach
```

If needed, list sessions with:

```bash
tmux ls
```

### Basic tmux navigation

* Switch windows: `Ctrl+b` then `n` / `p`
* List windows: `Ctrl+b` then `w`
* Switch panes: `Ctrl+b` then arrow keys
* Scroll mode: `Ctrl+b` then `[`; press `q` to exit

### Finding a problematic node

1. Cycle through panes/windows.
2. Look for stack traces, errors, or restarts.
3. Use scroll mode to inspect recent logs.

### Common hardware issues

#### Arm goes limp / servos not holding

Usually a servo communication issue.

Option 1 (recommended): reboot arm in app

1. Open Innate Controller App.
2. Go to **Configuration**.
3. Open **Dev** tab.
4. Tap **Reboot Arm**.

Option 2: full robot power cycle

1. Unplug robot power.
2. Wait a few seconds.
3. Plug it back in.

#### Arm restart notifications

If the app prompts an arm restart, follow it to recover from servo communication failures.

#### Arm overload protection

If servo load is too high, torque may reduce for protection. If this happens:

1. Remove heavy object from gripper.
2. Clear obstructions.
3. Reboot arm via app if needed.

#### iOS arm control limitation

Leader arm teleoperation via USB-C is currently not supported on iOS. Reach out on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/KtkyT97kc7) for Android access options.

### Low battery warning

The app shows a pulsing **Battery Low** warning under `10.53V`.

When this appears:

1. Stop active tasks.
2. Move robot to charging location.
3. Connect charger.

Avoid running updates or heavy operations at low battery.

## FAQ

<Accordion title="chevron-rightHow do I find my MARS ID?">
  Your MARS ID is a unique number assigned to your robot.

  **Via Bluetooth**

  In the app Bluetooth list, your robot appears with names like **"MARS the 1st"**, **"MARS the 5th"**, etc. That number is the MARS ID.

  **Via robot_info.json**

  If you can SSH into your robot:

  ```bash
  cat ~/innate-os-data/robot_info.json
```

  Check the `robot_id` field.
