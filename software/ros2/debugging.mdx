Use SSH + tmux + ROS2 CLI to debug quickly on robot.

## Basic workflow

1. SSH into MARS.
2. Attach to runtime session with `tmux attach`.
3. Inspect active nodes, topics, and logs.

## Useful commands

```bash
ros2 node list
ros2 topic list
ros2 service list
ros2 doctor
```

For hardware/runtime issue patterns, see [Troubleshooting](/robots/mars/troubleshooting).

For visualization workflows (RViz and flora.fan + Foxglove Bridge), see [ROS2 Overview](/software/ros2-core#visualization).
