title: "Manipulation Stack"
---

MARS manipulation combines arm interfaces, controllers, and learned policy execution.

## What to know

* Arm state is exposed through joint-state topics
* Motion commands can be sent through arm services/interfaces
* Learned manipulation policies are deployed as skills in the higher-level stack

## Useful checks

```bash
ros2 topic echo /joint_states
ros2 topic echo /mars/arm/state
```

For high-level usage, see [Capabilities](/robots/mars/capabilities).
