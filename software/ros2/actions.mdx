Use ROS2 actions for long-running tasks with feedback and cancellation.

## Typical usage

Actions are useful when execution takes time and you need progress updates (for example navigation goals or complex motion routines).

## Quick commands

```bash
ros2 action list
ros2 action info <action_name>
```

For stack-specific details, see [Navigation Stack](/software/ros2/navigation-stack) and [Manipulation Stack](/software/ros2/manipulation-stack).
