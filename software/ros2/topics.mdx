Use ROS2 topics for streaming robot state and continuous commands.

## Topic Interface

<RosTopicsInterface />

## How to read PUB/SUB

The **Dir** column is from the robot runtime perspective. `PUB` means MARS publishes that topic and you subscribe to it. `SUB` means MARS subscribes to that topic and you can publish commands to it.

## Quick commands

```bash
ros2 topic list
ros2 topic list -t
ros2 topic echo /battery_state
ros2 topic hz /scan
ros2 topic info /cmd_vel
```
