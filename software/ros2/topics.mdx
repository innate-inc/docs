Use ROS2 topics for streaming robot state and continuous commands.

## Common topics

* `/cmd_vel` (`geometry_msgs/Twist`) for base velocity commands
* `/odom` (`nav_msgs/Odometry`) for odometry
* `/battery_state` (`sensor_msgs/BatteryState`) for battery telemetry
* `/scan` (`sensor_msgs/LaserScan`) for LiDAR
* `/mars/main_camera/image` (`sensor_msgs/Image`) for RGB camera

## Quick commands

```bash
ros2 topic list
ros2 topic echo /battery_state
ros2 topic hz /scan
```
