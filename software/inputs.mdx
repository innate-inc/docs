Inputs let you send additional data asynchronously to BASIC while an agent is running.

They are useful when integrating external signals such as:

* Added sensors (for example: directional microphone, air-quality sensor)
* Network events (for example: incoming emails, webhook alerts)
* Internal robot status events

The most important part: an input can send live feedback to BASIC while the agent is executing.

## Minimal input example (stripped down)

```python
import threading
from brain_client.input_types import InputDevice

class AlertsInput(InputDevice):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self._stop = threading.Event()

    @property
    def name(self) -> str:
        return "alerts_input"

    def on_open(self):
        self._stop.clear()

        def loop():
            while not self._stop.is_set():
                events = self._poll_events()  # your sensor/API hook
                for event_text in events:
                    # Async feedback to BASIC during agent execution
                    self.send_data(event_text, data_type="chat_in")
                self._stop.wait(1.0)

        threading.Thread(target=loop, daemon=True).start()

    def on_close(self):
        self._stop.set()

    def _poll_events(self):
        return []
```

## Attach it to an agent

```python
def get_inputs(self) -> list[str]:
    return ["alerts_input"]
```

When this agent starts, `on_open()` is called and BASIC begins receiving these asynchronous updates.
