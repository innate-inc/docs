## Do I need to know ROS2?

**For most developers: no.** The Agent and Skill abstractions handle all the ROS2 complexity for you. You can build powerful robot applications without ever touching a ROS2 topic or service directly.

However, if you're a roboticist who wants low-level access to sensor data, custom motion control, or integration with other ROS2 systems, MARS gives you full access to the underlying ROS2 layer.

## What is ROS2?

ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) is a middleware framework for robotics. It provides:

* **Topics**: Pub/sub messaging for streaming data (camera images, odometry, commands)

* **Services**: Request/response calls for one-off operations (turn on lights, get status)

* **Actions**: Long-running tasks with feedback (navigate to a point, execute a trajectory)

MARS runs ROS2 Humble on Ubuntu 22.04, with Zenoh as the DDS (networking) layer.

## Architecture Overview

The Innate OS has two main package groups:

### Brain (the "thinking" layer)

* **brain\_client**: The main orchestrator that runs agents, loads skills, and bridges to BASIC (cloud agent)

* **brain\_messages**: Custom message types for the brain system

* **manipulation**: Behavior server for arm control using learned policies

### Maurice Bot (the "body" layer)

* **maurice\_bringup**: Hardware initialization (cameras, battery, UART)

* **maurice\_arm**: Arm kinematics and motion planning (MoveIt2)

* **maurice\_nav**: Navigation stack (Nav2, SLAM)

* **maurice\_cam**: Camera drivers (OAK-D via DepthAI)

* **maurice\_msgs**: Custom messages for MARS hardware

* And several more for simulation, logging, and Bluetooth provisioning

## Common Use Cases

**"I want to read raw camera data"** → Subscribe to `/oak/rgb/image_raw` (sensor\_msgs/Image)

**"I want to manually drive the robot"** → Publish to `/cmd_vel` (geometry\_msgs/Twist)

**"I want to check battery level"** → Subscribe to `/battery_state` (sensor\_msgs/BatteryState)

**"I want to move the arm to a specific position"** → Use the `/goto_js` service or MoveIt2 interfaces (see advanced docs)
