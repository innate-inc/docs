title: "Starting an Agent"
---

Once you've created an agent, you can activate it through the Controller App or directly on the robot.

## Using the Controller App

Open the **Innate Controller App**, connect to your robot on the same network, then go to the **Home** screen and tap an agent card to activate it. To switch agents, tap a different card. To stop the current one, use the stop button.

## Setting a Default Agent

You can configure an agent to start automatically when the robot boots.

In the Controller App, go to **Home**, long-press an agent card, and select **Set as default**. The app marks it as default. To remove it, long-press again and select **Remove default**.

## Activation Sequence

When you activate an agent, the runtime loads its skills, opens its inputs, uploads the prompt, enables gaze if configured, and starts the perception/decision loop. This typically completes in about one second.

## Switching Between Agents

Switching is immediate: the current agent is torn down, the new one is loaded, and in-progress actions from the previous agent are cancelled rather than completed.

## Troubleshooting

### Agent doesn't appear in the app

Check that the file is in `~/agents`, then on the app **Home** screen swipe down (pull-to-refresh) to reload the agent list. If it still does not appear, verify the file imports without Python errors and inspect runtime logs using the [Troubleshooting guide](/robots/mars/troubleshooting#navigate-tmux-to-find-issues).

### Agent won't start

Check robot logs for startup errors (see [Troubleshooting](/robots/mars/troubleshooting#navigate-tmux-to-find-issues)), confirm every skill listed in `get_skills()` exists, and ensure the prompt is valid for the behavior you expect.

### Agent starts but robot is unresponsive

Usually this is a prompt or wiring issue. Tighten the prompt wording, verify required skills are in `get_skills()`, and confirm necessary inputs (for example `micro`) are present in `get_inputs()`.
