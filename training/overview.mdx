This section is **TBD — currently in writing**.

For now, this page summarizes what is already available in the product.

## What is available now

Manipulation skills powered by end-to-end models show up in the app under **Skills** -> **Physical Skills** once they are available on your robot.

At this stage, these learned skills are **mobile manipulation skills**: they combine movement in the environment with arm actions, rather than arm-only stationary routines.

## What will be documented here

The full documentation for the learned manipulation workflow (data collection, dataset format, training, evaluation, and deployment) is being consolidated into this section and will be expanded soon.
