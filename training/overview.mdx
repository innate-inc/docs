This part of the documentation is **not complete yet** and is currently being written.

The only part we are documenting in detail right now is the in-app dataset workflow: recording episodes from the phone app, reviewing recorded data, and replaying episodes in-app.

Go to [Recording Data](/training/data-collection) for the current workflow.

## Current state in the product

Manipulation skills powered by end-to-end models appear in the app under **Skills** -> **Physical** once they are available on your robot.

At this stage, these learned skills are **mobile manipulation skills**: they combine movement in the environment with arm actions.

## What will be documented here

This section will be expanded with complete docs for dataset format, training, evaluation, and deployment.
