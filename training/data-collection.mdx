title: "Recording Data"
---

This page documents what is already available in the Innate Controller App for collecting manipulation data.  
The rest of the Manipulation docs are still in progress.

## Where to record data

In the app, open **Skills**, stay on the **Physical** tab, and open the skill you want to collect data for.  
Inside that skill page, open **Dataset**.

You will see an episodes counter (`N episodes`), the current episode list, and a **Record Episode** button.

## Record a new episode

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open record screen">
    In the skill&apos;s **Dataset** tab, tap **Record Episode**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable arm streaming">
    On the recorder screen, toggle **Arm** on.  
    The **Record** button is enabled only when arm updates are flowing (you will see an MPS value).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Capture the demonstration">
    Press **Record**, teleoperate the robot, then press **Stop** when done.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save or discard">
    After stopping, choose **Save** to keep the episode, or **Discard** to drop it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Review your dataset

After saving, return to the skill&apos;s **Dataset** tab to inspect your episodes.  
Each episode card shows an episode index plus timestamp metadata.

To replay an episode, tap the card (or the play icon) to open **Episode Replay**.

In replay, you can play/pause, stop, and view progress with elapsed time.

## Create a new physical skill dataset

If you need a new dataset/skill entry first:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create skill entry">
    In **Skills** (Physical tab), tap the **+** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name it">
    Enter a name in **Enter Action name here**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start collecting">
    Tap **Create Physical Skill**. The app opens the episode recorder directly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Note on training

The **Train** tab currently shows **Coming Soon** in the app and is planned for version **1.1.0**.  
Using Innate&apos;s fast training service requires a valid **Innate service key** on your robot/account.  
Training workflow docs will be added here as they are finalized.
