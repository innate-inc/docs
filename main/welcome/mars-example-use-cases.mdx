1. [Welcome](/main/welcome)

As an extensible general-purpose robot, MARS can be used for a wide array of use-cases, which can be further increased with additional sensors and effectors.

All the examples below are possible autonomously — some of them might require more data than we have collected so far.

* A Desk Personal Productivity companion that hits you whenever you look at your phone or when it sees you are not working on your screen.

* An Elderly Companion that takes notes during the day of what your grand-parents do and can remind them to take their medicine.

* A floor decluttering robot that takes legos and trash off the floor and in a particular bin in another room.

* A Chess Playing Robot that roasts you while you play (or adopts a different character depending on the user).

* A Security Robot that can open doors and explore the place, and call 911 if it sees someone.

* A food serving robot that can put food in your plate when you show one in front of it.

* A concierge robot that gives indication to visitors, flyers, and drives them to destination.

## Autonomous demos

The videos below show real autonomous deployments of MARS in different situations. All were accomplished with training the arm and running the BASIC agent.
