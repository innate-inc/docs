title: "Navigation Stack"
---

MARS navigation is built on Nav2 plus MARS-specific wrappers.

## What to know

* `/cmd_vel` drives base motion
* `/odom` and `/scan` are core for localization and obstacle avoidance
* App navigation modes map to ROS2-level behavior mode changes

## Validate navigation signals

```bash
ros2 topic echo /odom
ros2 topic echo /scan
```

For mode behavior from the app side, see [Capabilities](/main/robots/mars/capabilities).
