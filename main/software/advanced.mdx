title: "Overview"

This section is for roboticists and developers who want to go beyond the Agent/Skill abstraction and work directly with the underlying systems.

**You probably don't need this.** Most developers can build complete robot applications using just Agents, Skills, and Inputs. This section is for those who want low-level control or need to debug system internals.
