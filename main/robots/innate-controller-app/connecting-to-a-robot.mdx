The Innate App connects to your robot via WiFi. It can also work with your phone hotspot.

## First-Time Connection

If this is the first time you are connecting, the app will guide you through an onboarding flow:

1. **Bluetooth Pairing** — The app uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to discover your robot and configure its network settings

2. **WiFi Configuration** — Tell the robot which network to connect to

3. **Connection** — Once on the same network, the app connects to the robot via WiFi

The robot publishes its hostname with a `.local` suffix (e.g., `mars-robot.local`), making it easy to connect even if the IP address changes.

Once connected, you can also get your current IP on the network in the Configuration Tab -> WiFi
