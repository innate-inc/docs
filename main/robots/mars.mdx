MARS is a small mobile manipulator packing all of the hardware and AI required to run a complete AI Robot. It is designed for hobbyists wanting to develop and share physical applications developed on it.

## What do I get with MARS?

MARS is a lot more than a few pieces of hardware strapped together. It is a fully assembled, calibrated robot, that we designed to run AI algorithms properly.

MARS's arm and visual stack is designed so that VLAs can run repeatably.

The robot itself is robust enough to resist (reasonable) **falls, shocks**, and can easily be **opened** and **modded.**

MARS is basically a small research platform, but with a software made for engineers and builders.

## Open-source

MARS is open-source, so that you can quickly modify it or develop your own stack on top of it.

## **** [**REPOSITORY**](https://innate.bot/mars_repo)

You can buy an assembled and calibrated MARS from [our website](https://innate.bot/).
