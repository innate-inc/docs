<Accordion title="chevron-rightHow do I find my MARS ID?">
  Your MARS ID is a unique number assigned to your robot. There are two ways to find it:

  **Via Bluetooth**

  When you turn on your robot and look for it in the Innate app's Bluetooth connections screen, the robot will appear with a name like **"MARS the 1st"**, **"MARS the 2nd"**, etc. The number in the name is your MARS ID.

  For example:

  * "MARS the 1st" → MARS ID **1**

  * "MARS the 5th" → MARS ID **5**

  * "MARS the 12th" → MARS ID **12**

  **Via robot\_info.json**

  If you can SSH into your robot, you can also find the ID in the robot info file:

  Copy

  ```
  cat ~/innate-os-data/robot_info.json
  ```

  Look for the `robot_id` field in the JSON output.
