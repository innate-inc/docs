Calibrate stereo depth to ensure stable obstacle avoidance and navigation behavior.

MARS uses stereo depth for navigation and obstacle avoidance. Because cameras vary slightly across units, each robot must be calibrated.

Run calibration:

* After first setup
* After major OS updates that include depth changes
* Any time depth readings appear unstable

## 1) Prepare the calibration board

Download and print:

* [Calibration board PDF](https://github.com/innate-inc/web-docs/blob/main/.gitbook/assets/mars-calibration-board.pdf)

<Frame caption="Print this board at 100% scale.">

Setup notes:

* Print at **100% scale** (no fit-to-page scaling)
* Mount it flat on a letter-sized cardboard backing
* Do not cover checker squares or markers
* Flatness matters more than perfect edge trimming

## 2) Start calibration from the app

1. Open the Innate Controller App.
2. Go to **Configuration** -> **Depth**.
3. Tap **Start calibration**.

When MARS raises its hand:

* Place the board in front of the hand, pattern facing the robot head
* Hold steady until MARS grabs it

## 3) Let calibration complete

* Stay clear while MARS runs the sequence
* Wait for completion status in the app
* If it fails, repeat with better board flatness and stability

After completion, run **Configuration** -> **Depth** -> **Check depth** before normal navigation.
